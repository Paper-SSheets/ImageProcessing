This project was an image processing assignment where we were to implement the famous sobel filter.

Honestly, the coolest part of the assignment, other than completing it (which took me longer than I'd like to admit), was the YouTube video Jeremy gave us, I love computerphile!

I know the focus of this assignment is probably more just to get accustomed to the Linux environment or whatever environment we choose to use for this class. This is actually the first README and Makefile and CHANGELOG I've created so that's pretty cool. :)
